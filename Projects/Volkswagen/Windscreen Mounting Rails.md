# Radar Detector, Dash Cam Rails

**Issue to solve**
I noticed that my radar detector fell off the car once the windscreen got really hot in direct sun. Then the wire also fell out from the top of the visor. This could easily happen to the dash cam too.
1. Provide the radar detector a better bracket to attach to
2. Provide the dash cam a better bracket to attach to
3. Provide wires at top of windscreen a path to easily follow to the A-pillars
4. Creatively adhere bracket to the windshield via the A-pillars

This would be fun regardless because it would allow me to mount overhead switches, which is just a cool this to have. We could do the garage door opener, radar detector, dash cam, and all the assorted wires that go with this. 

**Tools to use**
- I think there are two main routes to go:
	1. 3D printing
	2. Wood (dad project?)
	3. Plastic and hand cutting
- Easiest method is 3D printing holder brackets and then using some metal to span the gap between the brackets across the windshield
- 3D Printing would also be needed for the brackets for what *actually gets mounted to the rails*
