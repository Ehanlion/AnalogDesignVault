# About This Vault

This vault is best used when opened with Obsidian, the note taking application. This vault is a collection of all my most important and refined notes about Analog Design. Throughout my undergraduate, one of the biggest issues I faced was not having notes worthy of looking back on. This vault serves to collect golden copies of my most important notes into one, consolidated location. 

Of course, more stuff is in here as well. Things like project notes, textbook readings, textbook notes, drawings, figures, and snippets from important resources. This vault is a place where I can note-take and write down my learnings on Analog Design on my road to becoming an Analog Designer.
